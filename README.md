#### Hi, I’m @Tuckertcs!

I’m interested in game and software design/development.

I’m currently studying computer science, game development, and mathematics as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin Stout.

I'm majoring in Computer Science, with a focus on Game Design, and I'm minoring Mathematics.

I’m looking to collaborate on indie or triple-A games, and software products small and large.
