### Hi, I’m Tuckertcs!

I’m interested in game and software design/development.

I’m currently studying computer science, game development, and mathematics as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin Stout.

I'm majoring in computer science, with a consentration on game design & development, and I'm minoring Mathematics.

I’m looking to collaborate on game projects from indie to triple-A, and software products small and large.
